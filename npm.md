so npx is a way to use a package without actually downloading it(on the go)





---

```
npm run build is equals to npm build
and npm run start is equals to npm start
```

```
npm -D  is same as npm --save-dev
```

---
when we install packages globally,some packages can give us some global commands for example when we install angular-cli globally, it gives us "ng" command and when we install typescript it gives us "tsc" command
ex:
```
npm install -g typescript
```

```
tsc --help
//tsc is short for typescript compiler
```
